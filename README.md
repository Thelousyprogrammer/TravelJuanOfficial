Welcome to TravelJuan! The commuter companion application made for commuters, by commuters.

TravelJuan is a project for a commuter companion app that serves the Filipino commuters as well as tourists who are visiting The Philippines. It comprises of the following sections:

1. Menu - This is where it showcases the nearest metro station, landmarks near within the station, beepcard balance overview, alerts for operation problems/delays, coupons and rolling stock information. (Coupons and Rolling Stock Info is not yet developed as of this build writing.)

2. Ride - This section comprises of Map, where you can select a rail station nearby and where you select a particular route that you want to travel.

3. Tickets - This section comprises of your ticket card, top up, and add/remove cards. The add/remove cards feature is only for beepcards. All expired beepcards will still have transferrable load within a year since expiration using the app. (Top up, Add/Remove Beepcards will still be developing at a later date!)

4. Account - This section comprises of your personal information. Options like customer service, account deletion and many more will be added to this particular section in later developments.

5. Guide - This section is used to explore The Philippines by Rail with ranging landmarks nearby stations at either walking distance or riding another mode of transport! This can be accessed in the Ride section at the top right of the app!

Originally built using React Native with Firebase integration, this build currently supports Android Development and an upcoming iOS Development support will be released at a later date!

This build is now also marked as the v1.0.0 OCV. The OCV represents Official Community Version where anyone in the development community can reproduce this application using a different language, or an update for adding new features, upgraded tech stack, and many more. Feel free to clone and create/upgrade this application with the sole goal of imrpoving the commuting experience one travel at a time.

Happy developing, and remember:
Move people, not cars!
